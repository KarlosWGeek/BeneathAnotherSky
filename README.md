# Beneath Another Sky

**Beneath Another Sky** is a total conversion mod for Europa Universalis V set in the original fantasy world of **Elysium**, where magic is a rare lost art that is slowly returning as the world recovers from cataclysm of centuries past. But now, with the advancements in technology and the rediscovery of ancient arcane relics, long-lost trade routes are open and a new era of discovery and exploration begins. Will you rule over the new rising powers or try to keep old powers from losing their edge as the world becomes larger and its people more interconnected? The choice is yours to make.

## Ambitions

The main goal of this project is to create a world that feels alive with endless possibility, not being tied to real-world history, science and technology, but instead making a new world with magic, alternative technologies, speculative science and evolution, multiple human races, etc.
The aim is for a **soft realism** approach, where realism and speculative evolution is preferred over magic and fantasy, but they still exist with some degree of plausibility mixed with pure fiction.
The best example of this is magic, which exists as a very broad reality-altering power that is still grounded by following certain rules and expectations of what is and isn't possible, and why. We also aim to fully explore the consequences of the existence of magic not just as a tool for mankind but also as a natural resource that the flora and fauna of this world have evolved to take advantage of.

## Progress

To fully flesh out the world of **Elysium** and invest the player into its characters and setting, hundreds of nations, cultures, religions, events and centuries of history will need to be painstakingly handcrafted one by one.
This process will take a very long time to finish so we'll be focusing on each continent and region one by one, updating the mod whenever we are satisfied with the amount of progress added.
The rest of the map will be included as impassable wasteland/ocean, but this is only a temporary measure as we add more content to each of the regions as well as try to balance the effects and modifiers of events, advancements, buildings, etc.

Currently we are working on our first update, **Alpha 1: Heyveil**. It will add content to the second largest continent in the world, **Heyveil**, home of the Southern Elves with their ancient ice and dark magic, their millennia-old traditions and feuds, not to mention their unique cultures, religions, buildings and events as you guide their nation towards the coming ages of rapid change and technological innovation.

## Development Team

Please remember that **Beneath Another Sky** is a large scale project being developed by a small passionate team of writers, coders, players, artists and creators in general. As such, development will take time and updates may be infrequent and contain bugs or errors. Make sure to report them when you find them so we can fix them as quickly as possible. We deeply appreciate your patience and support as we work to bring this vision to life.
We also welcome feedback, suggestions, and technical advice. If you are interested in contributing to the mod, whether with scripting, map design, 3D modeling, or event writing, we’d love to hear from you.
