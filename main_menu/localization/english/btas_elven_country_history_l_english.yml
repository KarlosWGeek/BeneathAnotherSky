 country_history_SOL: "In the frozen vastness of Heyveil lies the world's oldest nation: the Empire of Solace. The last of the Ancient Elven Empires, Solace remained neutral in Ancient Elven Wars and has dominated the continent for millenia. Its capital, Hei An Zuban, is the last intact Elven City from the Ancient Age and sits at the center of Blackstone Caldera, the most fertile region of the continent. Through this bounty in food, Solace holds most of Heyveil under the Mantle of the Depths: expecting tributes of wealth and resources in exchange for food to survive the Polar Winters.\n\nThe current ruler of Solace, Emperor Astra I of the Sol Dynasty rose to the throne in 529 after his father, Kai IV, was assassinated during a diplomatic expedition to Seongranguk. Widely considered one of the greatest rulers in elven history, Astra I ushered in an unprecedented Golden Age of peace, stability and economic revival through bureaucratic reform, infrastructure projects and agricultural expansion. To the tributaries, he gave greater autonomy and resolved many disputes, securing his popularity among them as well as the commonfolk.\n\nBehind the Empire's glimmering facade of strength and prosperity however lies a deep uncertainty: unmarried and childless, Astra I is the last member of the Sol Dynasty. His death will leave the throne vacant and the Empire's future uncertain. There is talk of transitioning the Empire to a republic and while this proposal has the Emperor's support, many do not agree. Already powerful forces move through the imperial halls: opportunists seeking power, noble houses, both old and new, seeking the throne, ambitious men seeking their own fiefs, false advisors and more all move among the shadows, gathering support, weakening the crown and destabilising the realm. And in the provinces, whispers spread: a chance to break free after millenia of rule. The danger goes further than the borders of Solace: if the Empire tears itself apart the food that many rely on to survive the Polar Winters will disappear as farms are razed and foodstuffs taken by battling armies: Famine and starvation would follow and untold numbers will die.\n\nFor as long as history has been recorded Solace has served as the anchor of Heyveil: a stabilizing force despite the tribute it extracts. The future seems bleak and only time will tell if the Empire of Solace, last of the Ancient Elven Empires, will weather the storms of change or be consigned to the winds of history."
