 elven_species: "Species: Elves"
 elven_species_desc: "Elves are the longest lived and most magicallly potent sentient humanoid species of Elysium. They are capable of learning and using powerful magic with ease even before adulthood, magic that other humaniod races struggle with. Elves are very asocial compared to other races, living in secluded villages or in small single-family homes amidst the wilderness. This was not always been the case, and is likely a result of their declining numbers and very slow recovery following the devastating Ancient Elven Wars, a period of global magical warfare that ended 10,000 years ago."
